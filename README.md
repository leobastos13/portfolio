This is my portfolio made with Javascript and using the kaboom.js library. It consists on a small mini game where you can explore the map and find out more about me as you bump into several objects.
You also have the option to see my resume and projects without playing the game, by checking those respective sections of the website.
This a web only portfolio. Hope you enjoy!
